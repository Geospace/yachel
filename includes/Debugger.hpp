// This class represents a debugger
// The debugger is "attached" to a running chip8
// As it is a friend of the chip8, it can directly expose
// its private stuff
//
// Logic:
// Chip8 runs in infinite loop, can be paused/resumed or whatever
// Breakpoints can also be added at anytime, even if the debugger is
// not attached
// The debugger has to be refreshed in the loop too so that it can catch
// any breakpoints
// !! Debugger needs to be refreshed before the next cycle is run
// When a breakpoint is catched, the chip8 is paused
// Execution can continue using steps, debugger does not need to be
// refreshed there
// When done, execution can be resumed

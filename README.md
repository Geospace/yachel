# Yachel

**Y**et **A**nother **C**hip **H**eight **E**mulation **L**ibrary

Yachel is a CHIP-8 emulation library, written in C++.

Yachel aims to provide you the tools to build a CHIP-8 emulator in no time. I
originally wrote it to help me write
[Yache](https://github.com/geospace/yache).

There is currently no documentation for Yachel but I should fix this soon (or
not...).
